Compatibility Matrix
====================

Supported OS Versions for Management Server
-------------------------------------------

This section describes the operating systems, browsers, and hypervisors
that have been newly tested and certified compatible with CloudStack
|version|. Most earlier OS and hypervisor versions are also still supported
for use with |version|. It might work well on other platforms, but the
platforms listed below are the ones that are specifically tested against
and are more likely to be able to help troubleshoot if you run into any
issues.

.. note:: that specific versions of the operating systems are tested, so compatibility with CentOS 6.3 may not
          indicate compatibility with CentOS 6.2, 6.1 and so on.

-  

   RHEL versions 5.5, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4

-  

   CentOS versions 6.3, and 6.4

-  

   Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Supported Hypervisor Versions
-----------------------------

CloudStack supports three hypervisor families, XenServer with XAPI, KVM,
and VMware with vSphere.

-  

   Windows Server 2012 R2 (with Hyper-V Role enabled)

-  

   Hyper-V 2012 R2

-  

   CentOS 6.2 with KVM

-  

   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 with KVM

-  

   XenServer 6.0.2 (with Hotfix)

-  

   XenServer versions 6.1 and 6.2 SPI with latest hotfixes

-  

   VMware versions 5.0, 5.1, and 5.5

-  

   Bare metal hosts are supported, which have no hypervisor. These hosts
   can run the following operating systems:

   -  

      RHEL or CentOS, v6.2 or 6.3

      .. note:: Use libvirt version 0.9.10 for CentOS 6.3

   -  

      Fedora 17

   -  

      Ubuntu 12.04

For more information, see the Hypervisor Compatibility Matrix in the
CloudStack Installation Guide.

Supported External Devices
--------------------------

-  

   Netscaler VPX and MPX versions 9.3 and 10.e

-  

   Netscaler SDX version 9.3

-  

   SRX (Model srx100b) versions 10.3 or higher

-  

   F5 10.1.0 (Build 3341.1084)

Supported Browsers
------------------

The CloudStack Web-based UI should be compatible with any modern
browser, but it's possible that some browsers will not render portions
of the UI reliably, depending on their support of Web standards. For
best results, one of the following browsers recommended:

-  

   Internet Explorer versions 10 and 11

-  

   Firefox version 26 or lower

-  

   Google Chrome version 31

-  

   Safari 5
