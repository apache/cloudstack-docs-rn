Compatibility Matrix
====================

Supported OS Versions for Management Server
-------------------------------------------

This section describes the operating systems, browsers, and hypervisors
that have been newly tested and certified compatible with CloudStack
|version|. Most earlier OS and hypervisor versions are also still supported
for use with |version|. It might work well on other platforms, but the
platforms listed below are the ones that are specifically tested against
and are more likely to be able to help troubleshoot if you run into any
issues.

.. note:: that specific versions of the operating systems are tested, so compatibility with CentOS 6.3 may not
          indicate compatibility with CentOS 6.2, 6.1 and so on.

- CentOS versions 6.5 (32 and 64 bit)
- FreeBSD 10 (32 and 64 bit)
- Microsoft Winows 8.1 (32 and 64 bit)
- Windows XP SP3 (32 and 64 bit)


Supported Hypervisor Versions
-----------------------------

No new supported hypervisors in |version|.

For more information, see the Hypervisor Compatibility Matrix in the `CloudStack Installation Guide`_.

Supported External Devices
--------------------------

No new supported External Devices in |version|.

For more information, see the `CloudStack Installation Guide`_.


Supported Browsers
------------------

The CloudStack Web-based UI should be compatible with any modern
browser, but it's possible that some browsers will not render portions
of the UI reliably, depending on their support of Web standards. For
best results, one of the following browsers recommended:

-  

   Internet Explorer versions 10 and 11

-  

   Firefox version 26 or lower

-  

   Google Chrome version 31

-  

   Safari 5
