"dynamic parameters. Dynamic Compute Offerings can be used in following "
"cases: deploying a VM, changing the compute offering of a stopped VM and "
"running VMs, which is nothing but scaling up. To support this feature a new "
"field, Custom, has been added to the Create Compute Offering page. If the "
