What's New in |version|
=======================

CloudStack |version| includes the following new features and improvements.


Support managed storage for root disks
--------------------------------------

   Use of Primary Storage Plug-in for Root disks. See `Configuring a Storage Plug-in 
   <http://docs.cloudstack.apache.org/projects/cloudstack-installation/en/master/configuration.html#configuring-a-storage-plug-in>`_
      
   ====================== ============================================================================
   Supported hypervisors: XenServer, VMware
   ====================== ============================================================================


Root disk resize
----------------

   Allow Root disk resize which remove need to have multiple templates of the 
   same Operating System for different disk size.
   
   ====================== ============================================================================
   Supported hypervisor:  KVM
   Link                   `Root resize Functional spec`_
   ====================== ============================================================================


Per primary Storage OverProvisioning
------------------------------------

   Added per Primary Storage ``storage.overprovisioning.factor`` setting to 
   overseed the Global Settings value.
   
   -  admin can update an existing primary store by setting 
      ``storage.overprovisioning.factor`` in the per primary setting.
   
   -  This value will override the value at the global level. This leverages 
      the granularity of global parameters introduced in 4.2
   
   -  To fall back to the global value, null value can be passed.
   
   -  To disable overprovision a value of 1 will be passed.
 
   ====================== ============================================================================
   Supported hypervisor:  KVM

   ====================== ============================================================================


VMWare Support for DRS
----------------------

   VMware DRS(Distributed Resource Scheduler), VM HA(High Availability): 
   Provide highly available resources to your workloads. Balance workloads for 
   optimal performance. Scale and manage computing resources without service 
   disruption.
   
   -  **Load Balancing**: distribution and usage of CPU and memory resources 
      for all hosts and VMs in the cluster are continuously monitored and 
      compared to ideal resource utilization given the attributes of the 
      cluster’s resource pools and VMs, the current demand, and the imbalance 
      target. It then performs (or recommends) virtual machine migrations 
      accordingly. Also, when a VM is powered on in the cluster, DRS attempts 
      to maintain proper load balancing by either placing the VM on an 
      appropriate host or making a recommendation.
   
   -  **Power Management**: When the vSphere Distributed Power Management 
      (DPM) feature is enabled, DRS compares cluster- and host-level capacity 
      to the demands of the cluster’s VMs, including recent historical demand. 
      It places (or recommends placing) hosts in standby  power mode if 
      sufficient excess capacity is found or powering on hosts if capacity is 
      needed. Depending on the resulting host power state  recommendations, 
      VMs might need to be migrated to and from the hosts as well.
   
   -  **Affinity Rules**: control the placement of virtual machines on hosts 
      within a cluster, by assigning affinity rules

   ====================== ============================================================================


CloudStack on Windows
---------------------

   Windowsfication of CloudStack Management Server, remove dependency on 
   cygwin in order to run CloudStack Management Server on Windows based 
   Operating System.

   networks accessibility across zones.

Virtual Router Service Failure Alerting
---------------------------------------

   Send failure alerts to management server to notify admins using `Monitoring
   VR services <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Monitoring+VR+services>`_
   introduced in CloudStack 4.3.

   ====================== ============================================================================
   Supported hypervisors: xenserver, kvm, vmware
   Link                   `VR failure alerting functional spec`_
   ====================== ============================================================================


Distributed routing and network ACL with OVS plug-in
----------------------------------------------------

   Support distributed routing and network ACL with OVS plug-in.

   ====================== ============================================================================
   Supported hypervisors: xenserver, kvm, vmware
   Link                   `CLOUDSTACK-6161 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-6161>`_

Hyper-V support improvements
----------------------------

Zone Wide Primary Store in Hyper-V
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   SMB share as zone wide primary storage.

   ====================== ============================================================================
   Supported hypervisors: Hyper-V
   Link                   `Hyper-V zone wide storage functional spec`_
   ====================== ============================================================================


VPC support on Hyper-V
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Provide VPC capability on Hyper-V hypervisor.
   
   ====================== ============================================================================
   Supported hypervisors: Hyper-V
   Link                   `VPC support on Hyper-V functional spec`_
   ====================== ============================================================================


Storage Live-Migration support for Hyper-V
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Hyper-V 2012 R2 allows migration of volumes (virtual disks) of a virtual
   machine from one storage to another, while the virtual machine continues to
   run. It also allows live migration of a virtual machine and its volumes to
   another host and storage without any downtime.

   The intend of this feature is to enable support of live migration of a
   virtual machines with its volumes across hosts and storage pools. It'll
   also migration of volumes across storage pools while the volume stays
   attached to a running virtual machine.
