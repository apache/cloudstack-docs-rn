------------------------------
   
The realhostip.com dynamic DNS resolution service is being retired on
September 30th, 2014. In advance of that, CloudStack 4.4 and later no longer uses 
realhostip.com DNS domains or SSL certificates to encrypt Console Proxy or 
file copy communications.

Settings Changes
----------------

After upgrading to 4.2 and later, Settings ``mem.overporvisioning.factor`` and 
``cpu.overporvisioning.factor`` are now at the cluster level and be set to 1 
which is the default.

If Global Settings ``mem.overporvisioning.factor`` and 
``cpu.overporvisioning.factor`` have been changed prior the upgrade to 4.2 and 
later, the upgrade process will be reset them to 1. Values can be changed by 
editing clusters settings.

All clusters created after the upgrade will get created with the Global Settings 
values for ``mem.overporvisioning.factor`` and ``cpu.overporvisioning.factor``.


OVS plug-in
-----------

OVS plug-in functionality is disrupted if ovsdaemon crashes

A critical functionality issue came out with `CLOUDSTACK-6779 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-6779>`_. On XenServer it
is observed that on VIF unplug Ovs-Vswitchd is crashing resulting in loosing all
the openflow rules added to the bridge. Ovs daemon gets started and creates a
bridge but configure openflow rules are lost resulting in the disruption of
connectivity for the VM's on the host.
